### What would be the time and space complexity of your program? Why?

Reading Input:
Time Complexity: O(m), where m is the number of lines in the input file. This is because we need to read each line and parse it into a number.

Parsing Numbers:
Time Complexity: O(m * log N), where m is the number of valid lines (since we only sort valid numbers) and N is the number of top results to output. Sorting involves O(m * log m) time complexity, but because we only sort up to N elements, it becomes O(m * log N).

Writing Output:
Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of top results to output. We write each of the top N numbers to the output file.

Overall Time Complexity: O(m * log N), dominated by the sorting step when m (number of valid lines) is large compared to N.

Space Complexity:
numbers []uint64: This array holds all valid numbers read from the input file. Therefore, the space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of valid lines in the input file.


### Do you think there is still room for improvement in your solution? If so, please elaborate.

Efficiency in Sorting:
Currently, the program sorts all valid numbers to find the top N largest. For very large input files with tens of millions of lines, this sorting operation could be optimized further. One approach could involve using a min-heap (priority queue) of size N to efficiently maintain the top N largest numbers as we iterate through the input.

Parallelism:
Given the potential size of input files, parallelizing the input reading and possibly the sorting process (using Go's goroutines) could provide performance benefits, especially on multi-core systems.

Optimized Input Parsing:
Enhancing the parsing logic to skip over invalid lines more efficiently could reduce unnecessary processing time, especially in cases where there are many invalid lines.

Memory Efficiency:
Although Go's standard libraries are used, exploring more memory-efficient data structures or algorithms for sorting and maintaining the top N elements could be beneficial, especially if memory constraints are a concern.
In conclusion, while the current implementation meets the basic requirements, there are indeed areas where further optimization and improvement could enhance its performance, especially when dealing with very large input files and strict performance requirements.
